# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# fitness_tracker
The **Fitness Tracker** is a web app that helps users log workouts, set goals, track progress, and get personalized fitness advice. It includes workout logging, progress visualization, nutrition tracking, and community features. The app integrates with wearables, ensuring a comprehensive fitness experience.

Fitness Tracker - Project Overview

Problem Statement

With the growing awareness of fitness and health, individuals often face challenges in tracking their physical activities, monitoring their progress, and staying motivated to achieve fitness goals. Many people struggle to maintain a consistent workout routine, track their progress effectively, or get personalized fitness insights. There is a need for a user-friendly, interactive platform that allows users to log workouts, set fitness goals, monitor their progress, and receive personalized fitness suggestions.

The Fitness Tracker web application aims to solve these problems by providing users with a comprehensive, interactive tool to log and track their workouts, set fitness goals, monitor progress through visualizations, and get personalized fitness advice. It serves as a motivating tool to help users stay on track and achieve their fitness goals.

Features & Functionality

	1.	User Authentication and Authorization
	•	Login/Registration: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.

	•	Profile Management: Users can edit their personal details, including age, weight, fitness goals, and preferences.
	2.	Workout Logging
	•	Exercise Categories: Users can log different types of workouts like cardio, strength training, flexibility exercises, etc.
	•	Exercise History: Users can add details for each workout session, such as exercise type, duration, repetitions, and sets.
	•	Custom Workouts: Users can create custom workouts, specifying their exercises, sets, reps, and rest times.
	3.	Goal Setting & Tracking
	•	Fitness Goals: Users can set short-term and long-term goals, such as weight loss, muscle gain, running distance, etc.
	•	Progress Tracking: Track progress on goals by monitoring metrics like calories burned, steps taken, weight lifted, or workout duration.
	•	Achievements & Milestones: Users can unlock achievements or milestones as they reach certain goals, e.g., 100 workouts completed.
	4.	Workout Plans
	•	Predefined Plans: Offer users workout plans for various fitness levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced) or specific goals (weight loss, muscle gain, etc.).
	•	Personalized Plans: Based on user input (age, fitness goals, preferences), the app can recommend personalized workout plans.
	•	Workout Templates: Users can save their favorite workout routines or create templates to reuse in future sessions.
	5.	Progress Visualization
	•	Charts & Graphs: Display progress over time using line charts or bar graphs to track metrics like weight loss, strength gains, or workout frequency.
	•	Fitness Stats: Track key metrics such as calories burned, distance run, total workout time, and weight lifted.
	•	Leaderboard: If the app has social features, include a leaderboard to compare the user’s progress with friends or the community.
	6.	Nutrition Tracking
	•	Calorie Intake: Allow users to log daily meals and track calorie intake based on the calories burned during workouts.
	•	Meal Suggestions: Provide healthy meal suggestions based on the user’s fitness goals, such as low-calorie meals for weight loss or high-protein meals for muscle gain.
	•	Macronutrient Breakdown: Track the balance of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates in the user’s diet.
	7.	Fitness Tips & Motivation
	•	Daily Tips: Offer daily fitness or wellness tips, such as stretches, exercise techniques, or motivational quotes.
	•	Push Notifications: Send reminders to users to log their workouts or drink water.

	•	Chart.js or D3.js: Create graphs and visualizations for tracking progress (e.g., calories burned, workouts completed).
	•	Bootstrap or Material UI: Design a responsive and user-friendly interface.
	2.	Backend (Spring Boot)
	•	Spring Boot: Build RESTful APIs to handle workout logging, user management, and goal tracking.
	•	Spring Security: Implement user authentication and authorization (JWT or OAuth2).
	•	JPA/Hibernate: Handle database operations for storing user profiles, workouts, and progress.
	•	Spring Data JPA: Use for querying and managing the MySQL database.
	3.	Database (MySQL)
